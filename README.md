# KeyShield by Caspar St√§hlin
KeyShield is a Chrome extension that allows you to create strong and secure passwords on the fly.
Users have the Choice between:
  - Only Letters & Number
  - Special Characters

After that, a strong and completely random password is made for you to use. None of the passwords are saved by the program, so they are impossible to find and completely anonymous.
